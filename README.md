## Welcome to TerraOak-Azure!
![TerraOak](oak9-logo.png)

TerraOak is [oak9](https://oak9.io)'s vulnerable Infrastructure as Code repository. This repository contains deployable resource configurations for Microsoft Azure, which have been intentionally designed to be vulnerable for learning purposes.

## Table of Contents

* [Introduction](#introduction)
* [Docker Setup](#running-inside-a-docker-container)
* [Terraform Code Execution](#terraform-code-execution)
* [oak9 CLI Execution](#oak9-cli-execution)

## Introduction 
Before proceeding, please read the following disclaimer:
> :warning: TerraOak contains multiple examples of code displaying common IaC misconfigurations. These were developed with the intention of showcasing the impact of oak9's powerful CLI and dynamic blueprint engine on improving organizational security posture. Use at your own discretion; oak9 is not responsible for any damages.

 **Please use caution when using this codebase and ensure that you have appropriate permissions to deploy resources in your Azure environment. Always follow best practices for securing your cloud infrastructure and consult with your organization's security team before deploying any code to production environments.**

 ## Running oak9 inside a Docker container

- Use Docker Hub to pull down the latest oak9 CLI container
  `docker pull oak9/cli`
- Setup environmental variables for your CLI Integration. Run the following command replacing the provided values with details from your oak9 Integration.
`docker run --e OAK9_API_KEY=<oak9-api-key> --e OAK9_PROJECT_ID=<oak9-project-id> --e OAK9_DIR=<terraoak.azure/terraform.azure/vulnerable> ubuntu env | grep VAR`

## Terraform Code Execution

* Clone or fork this repository
* Ensure [minimum version requirements](#requirements) are met 
* Run `terraform init`
* Run `terraform plan` or `terraform apply`
* Add an API user
`curl -X POST "$(terraform output -raw base_url)/set-user?id=0&name=john&orgid=xyx&plan=enterprise&orgname=xyzdfd&creationdate=82322"`

* Retrieve an API user 
`curl "$(terraform output -raw base_url)/get-user?id=0"`
